12/1/2020 {Surya} - Implemented the file-i/o for reading in the index-name map

12/3/2020 {Saarth}- created a search suggestions function to find possible related topics to a key word

12/4/2020 {Vedant} - Added the very basic graph implemetnation, still need to do remove and insert functions. 
Referenced lectures and lab code extensively. Done with shortest route algorithm 

12/6/2020 {Surya}- Changed the graph implementation to use the CS 225 version. This will come in handy for implementing the 
traversals and other algorithms. Added the BFS traversal and converted the shortest route algorithm to use the new Graph
implementation.


12/6/2020 {Saarth}- Made DFS for the graph. 
12/7/2020 {Saarth}- Made Page ranking for the graph.  Need to run further test to see of there is at least one outgoing edge per node 

12/10/2020 = {Surya} - Added file-i/o for cs225 testing support and moved all the game logic to WikiNames.

12/10/2020 {Vedant} - added a few test cases for shortest route to show how we tested it
12/11/2020 {Saarth} - Cleaned up test cases and finalized codebase.
